# Capstone-Project
Intracranial Waveform Generator

This project consists of multiple componenets including: computational waveform modeling, digital to analog conversion, and a GUI creation. 

It consists of both python and MATLAB files.

MATLAB was simpler for the waveform creation while the group had prior knowledge of python which made it easier to write the digital to analog conversion and GUI in python.
